# Cs188 Project

## Overview
This is a project for **CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**, offered by UC Berkeley. The project involves applying concepts from artificial intelligence to solve a variety of problems, ranging from search algorithms and machine learning to reinforcement learning.

The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate different AI algorithms, enhance understanding of AI techniques, and develop hands-on experience in building intelligent systems.

## Installation Instructions

To run this project locally, ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/<this-repo>.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <this-repo>
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Algorithm Implementation

### Search Algorithms:
This project includes several search algorithms commonly used in AI, including:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **A* Search** (with heuristics)

### Value Iteration:
We implemented **Value Iteration** to solve **Markov Decision Processes** (MDPs), which is used for decision-making tasks with a known model of the environment.

### Q-learning:
We implemented **Q-learning**, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that allows an agent to learn the optimal policy through trial and error.
